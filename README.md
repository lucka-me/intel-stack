## FAQ

### Why Intel Stack?

TL;DR: **Licensing**.

As you may have noticed, the [IITC Button](https://github.com/IITC-CE/IITC-Button) is the original and universal browser extension solution for all modern browsers **including Safari**. However, IITC Button and its core dependency, [lib-iitc-manager](https://github.com/IITC-CE/lib-iitc-manager) are both licensed under GPL-3.0, which is definitely incompatible with App Store. A possible solution was to sign a seperated agreements with all contributors, which is obviously very difficult.

### What's the difference with IITC Button?

Intel Stack is designed exclusivly for Apple platforms (iOS, iPadOS and macOS so far), and most core features are implemented with Swift instead of JavaScript, including a full-featured native app made with SwiftUI.
