## FAQ

### Why Intel Stack?

TL;DR: **Licensing**.

As you may have noticed, the [IITC Button](https://github.com/IITC-CE/IITC-Button) is the original and universal browser extension solution for all modern browsers **including Safari**. However, IITC Button and its core dependency, [lib-iitc-manager](https://github.com/IITC-CE/lib-iitc-manager) are both licensed under GPL-3.0, which is definitely incompatible with App Store. A possible solution was to sign a seperated agreements with all contributors, which is obviously very difficult.

### What's the difference with IITC Button?

Intel Stack is designed exclusivly for Apple platforms (iOS, iPadOS, macOS and visionOS), and most core features are implemented with Swift instead of JavaScript, including a full-featured native app made with SwiftUI.
